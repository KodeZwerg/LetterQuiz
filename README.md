 - kzLetterQuiz - a guess the letter class by KodeZwerg

With this class you can easy create your own "guess the letter" type of game.
It contain many neat pre-made things where you do not need to anymore to thing about :-D

It is compatible to Delphi and Lazarus, demonstration is limited to windows. (you just need to exchange one dialog or remove complete)

The demo shows you the most basic things, first of all it teach you the amount of different events that can be triggered.

I hope you will enjoy using it as much as i enjoyed creating it.
